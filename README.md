# Hibernate advanced: Many-to-many Relationship

## Description
Experiment with concepts of Hibernate, ORM (Objectâ€“relational mapping), and many-to-many mapping. In this project, we can see how:
* Configure Spring MVC in the XML file (/spring-mvc-demo/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml)
* Configure Spring MVC servlet in the XML file (/spring-mvc-demo/webapp/WEB-INF/spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml)
* Create controllers (firstPackage/...)
  * Map URLs to the approriate functions
  * Retrieve arguments from URLs for allowing functions to work
  * Using model to facilitate data results to be more flexible result than retrieve them directly from the HTML form
  * Return specific JSP file name from a particular function to eventually provide that JSP file to the user
* Create JSP files for views (/spring-mvc-demo/webapp/WEB-INF/view/...)
  * Files for input forms
  * Files for process forms that some of them will also utilize tags for validation purposes
* Create the custom validator (custom annotation)
