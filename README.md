# Spring MVC

## Description
Experiment with concepts of Spring MVC. In this project, we can see how:
* Configure Spring MVC in the XML file
* Configure Spring MVC servlet in the XML file
* Create controllers
  * Map URLs to the approriate functions
  * Retrieve arguments from URLs for allowing functions to work
  * Using model to facilitate data results to be more flexible result than retrieve them directly from the HTML form
  * Return specific JSP file name from a particular function to eventually provide that JSP file to the user
* Create JSP files for views
  * Files for input forms
  * Files for process forms that some of them will also utilize tags for validation purposes
* Create the custom validator (custom annotation)
